> Qualitative choice models, also known as discrete choice models, are used to model decisions in which individuals or entities choose between a finite set of alternatives, that is, we have a categorical dependent variable (Y = 1 or 0). Unlike other models, in this case the objective is to find the probability of occurrence of the binary event (dependent variable). 

### Model Types
1) Logit
2) Probit
3) Tobit
4) Poisson
5) Ordered Logit/Probit
6) Conditional Logit/Probit
